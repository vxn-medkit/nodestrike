NodeStrike Cryptographic Network Browser
(CC0) VXN Universal

Developed by some random nerds at VX, lol.
<readme>
  The NodeStrike design was premeditated by VXN Medkit on 20 October 2014 to be a powerful alternative technology to the Deep Web, allowing for a dynamic multi-network technorealm consisting of a structure very similar to the modern web.
  NodeStrike was designed with three main points in mind:
    - Ease of Use
    - Efficiency
    - Security
  For these three purposes:
    - Active Network Server and Client connections
    - High-strength Encryption for Communication
    - HTML-based interfaces throughout the software
  More guides can be found at the (upcoming) wiki page.

Mess around with the code, hack the government, build a worldwide super-network. I don't care, as long as you are having fun (without inflicting harm). -VXN Medkit
